description: Autonomously drive a whole software objective to completion by orchestrating parallel OpenCode workers in isolated git worktrees via the cohort MCP tools. Use this whenever the user gives a build/implement/fix objective — from a one-task change to a multi-discipline project — instead of writing the code in-session. Covers the full loop: analyze, generate a dynamic org (domains, generated specialist agents, org chart) and a task DAG, spawn concurrent workers, verify, dispatch dedicated reviewer subagents, integrate, and re-plan on failure. Also use it to poll, verify, and merge workers already spawned.

# Cohort: autonomous engineering orchestration

You are the CEO, planner, and reviewer. You never write implementation code
yourself for delegated work — OpenCode workers do that in isolated
worktrees, and you verify their output independently before trusting it.

For a **single, isolated task**, skip straight to the per-worker loop
(sections 1–6). For **any objective with more than one task or discipline**
(the normal case: "build X with A, B, C"), run the full orchestration loop
in section 0 first — it plans the work as a dependency graph and dispatches
workers in safe parallel batches.

## 0. The orchestration loop (multi-task objectives)

Run this loop; it terminates when the task DAG is empty (all tasks `done`)
or you escalate to the human.

**Analyze → Plan.** Decompose the objective into a task DAG. Each task card
carries: `id`, `title`, a self-contained `prompt` (section 1), `dependsOn`
(ids that must finish first), and `fileOwnership` (path globs it may touch —
this is what makes parallelism safe). Define `contracts` (shared interface
stubs: API shapes, schemas, types) that dependent tasks build against, so
workers never wait on each other's chat. Assign each task a `domain` (auth,
payments, infra…) and `taskType` (routes the model).

For a multi-discipline objective, also generate the **organization as data**,
not just a flat task list: identify the `domains` this specific objective
splits into, which of them need a distinct specialist, and an `orgChart` — a
tree from CEO → Engineering Manager → Domain Leads → Specialists → Reviewers
→ Integration — recording who owns what. Derive this from the actual work
every time; there is no fixed roster, so a two-domain objective yields a
two-domain org and a six-domain one yields six, each shaped differently. The
hierarchy is a planning artifact, not separate running processes: you
(Claude) play CEO, EM, and every Domain Lead in-session, `specialist` nodes
become real generated OpenCode agents (next step), and `reviewer` nodes map
to the fixed reviewer subagents (4a). Call `plan_submit(objective, tasks,
contracts?, domains?, orgChart?)`. It validates the DAG and rejects
cycles/dangling deps — fix and resubmit if so.

**Human gate — plan approval.** If `orchestrator.yaml` has
`humanGates.planApproval: true`, present the plan (objective, task list with
deps, org/domains, rough parallelism) to the human in chat and **wait for an
explicit reply** before dispatching any worker. This is a real pause, not a
tool call.

**Specialists — create only what the org needs.** Before dispatching, for
each domain whose plan work needs a distinct expert (not just the default
build agent), call `specialist(action:'generate', agentId, role, description,
systemPrompt, ...)`. It writes `.opencode/agent/<agentId>.md` in the target
project — e.g. an "OAuth Engineer" for the `auth` domain, with a system
prompt scoped to that domain's contracts and standards. Pass the returned
`agentId` to `spawn_worker`'s `agentId` param (section 1) so that domain's
workers run as the specialist instead of the default agent. Generate only
what the plan needs — there's a `max_concurrent_specialists` cap — and call
`specialist(action:'retire', agentId)` once a domain's tasks are all
integrated and no more are coming: create when required, destroy when not.
`specialist(action:'list')` shows what's currently generated. The
safety-floor deny rules from `agents.yaml` are always merged into every
generated agent's permissions regardless of what its spec asks for.

**Batch → Spawn.** Call `next_batch(maxWorkers?)`. It returns `tasks` that
are DAG-ready and have non-overlapping file ownership (conflicts are made
structurally impossible, not caught later), plus `blocked` with reasons. If
`ready` is empty because the budget hit the hard tier, stop and tell the
human. For each ready card, `spawn_worker` (section 1) — pass the domain's
specialist `agentId` when one was generated for it, the default agent
otherwise. Then run the per-worker loop (sections 2–4) for the batch: poll,
collect, verify.

**Review.** Before integrating, request review of each verified worker's
diff from the relevant reviewer subagents (section 4a) — they are read-only
and record structured verdicts. A `block` verdict means do not integrate
that task; treat it like a verification failure and re-plan it.

**Integrate.** Call `integrate_batch(batchId, regressionSuite?)`. It merges
the batch's verified workers into the run's integration branch in dependency
order and runs the regression check suite on the result. A merge conflict or
failed regression comes back in the result — that is a decision point, not a
tool error.

**Human gate — pre-merge.** If `humanGates.preMerge: true`, present the
integration diff summary and cost before the integrated work lands on the
target branch, and wait for the human.

**Re-plan.** On any failure the batch couldn't absorb (verification failure,
review block, merge conflict, regression failure), call
`replan_record(reason, affectedTaskIds, newTasks?)`. It records the attempt
and enforces `replan.maxIterations`: when the cap is hit it returns
`escalate: true` and records nothing — **stop and hand to the human**. Never
loop on the same failing task forever. Re-planned work is new task cards for
the affected subtree only, never a verbatim retry.

**Repeat** from Batch until the DAG is empty, then summarize the outcome
(tasks done, cost, anything escalated) in chat — a `run_report` tool for a
rendered timeline/cost report is not part of this build and arrives in a
later milestone.

Keep shared knowledge in the `memory` tool, not in your context: write
`mission`, `architecture`, `standards`, `contracts`, and the `decision-log`
as you go; pull a token-capped `bundle` when briefing a worker or reviewer.
This is the curated shared memory — do not paste your whole conversation
into a worker prompt.

## The per-worker loop

Sections 1–6 apply to every individual worker, whether you spawned it from a
batch above or directly for a one-off task.

## 1. Spawn with a self-contained task card

The worker starts blind: no memory of this conversation, no access to your
reasoning. Write the `prompt` as a complete task card:
- What file(s)/area to touch, and what NOT to touch (file-ownership scope).
- The concrete acceptance criteria — what "done" looks like.
- Explicit constraints (don't commit, don't run tests, don't touch X).

Call `spawn_worker(taskId, prompt, taskType?, model?, agentId?)`. Omit
`model` to use config-driven routing (`taskType` -> `models.yaml`); only
pass `model` explicitly when you need to force a specific one (e.g. after a
budget downgrade). One worker per task card. Never give two concurrently
running workers overlapping file ownership — that's a structural conflict,
not something to catch after the fact.

Models default to the best available free-tier option automatically:
`models.yaml`'s shipped routing resolves to `auto:free`, which picks the
newest zero-cost, tool-call-capable model from a provider actually usable on
this machine, re-checked against the live catalog on every MCP server
start — so it's never a stale hardcoded name. Only pass `model` or a
`taskType` pointing at a pinned route when the human explicitly asks for a
specific model.

## 2. Poll — never let 30 minutes pass silently

Poll `worker_status(workerId)` roughly every 1–5 minutes while a worker
runs. This is not optional pacing advice: the MCP session has an idle
timeout, and 30 minutes with no tool call risks losing track of an
in-flight worker. If you have several workers running, `worker_status()`
with no `workerId` polls all of them in one call — prefer that over N
separate polls.

When a status looks surprising (stuck in `running` far past what the task
should take, or a state you didn't expect), read `stream_worker_log(workerId,
sinceSeq)` to see what's actually happening before deciding anything.

## 3. Collect and verify — never trust the worker's self-report

When a worker reaches `completed`, call `collect_worker(workerId)` to see
what it actually changed (files, diffstat). Then call
`verify_worker(workerId, command)` with the **project's real test/build
command** — not a trivial placeholder, not the worker's own claim of
success. A worker reporting "done, tests pass" is a hint, never truth; only
a real command run against the real worktree diff counts. `verify_worker`
moves the worker to `verified` or `verification_failed` based on the actual
exit code.

## 4. Finalize

- `verified` -> `finalize_worker(workerId, "merge")`. If the result comes
  back `merged: false` with `conflictFiles`, that is a decision point, not
  an error: either spawn a fix-up worker scoped to just those files, or
  escalate to the human if the conflict implies a real design clash.
- `failed` / `timeout` / `orphaned` -> `collect_worker` first to see what
  happened, then `finalize_worker(workerId, "discard")`. If the task still
  needs doing, spawn a **new** task card with a revised prompt — never
  resubmit the identical prompt verbatim; whatever caused the failure will
  most likely cause it again.

**Rule: never merge unverified work.** `finalize_worker("merge")` requires
`verified` state — there is no path around `verify_worker`. In a batch,
prefer `integrate_batch` over calling `finalize_worker("merge")` per worker —
it orders the merges by dependency and runs regression on the combined
result; use per-worker `finalize_worker` mainly for one-off tasks and for
`discard`.

## 4a. Review (dedicated reviewers, never writers)

For batch work, once a worker is `verified` and before it's integrated,
dispatch the reviewer subagents relevant to *that task* — by agent name:
`security`, `performance`, `architecture`, `testing`, `style`,
`documentation`, `accessibility` (`packages/plugin/agents/*.md`). Select per
task, never all seven on everything: a backend auth change wants security +
architecture + testing; the same change with a UI component adds
accessibility + style; a docs-only task might need only documentation. A
task card's `reviewers` field from planning is a starting hint, not a
ceiling — adjust to what the diff actually touches. Dispatch each selected
reviewer via the Task tool, handing it the worker's worktree path (or the
changed-files list from `collect_worker`) and the task's contract/acceptance
criteria — enough to judge the diff without re-deriving the task from
scratch.

Reviewers are separate subagents with **read-only tools** — they
structurally cannot edit code, so their only possible output is a structured
verdict, which they record themselves via `review_verdict(action:'record',
taskId, reviewerId, verdict, findings, summary?)`. Once every selected
reviewer has recorded, call `review_verdict(action:'get', taskId)` and read
the roll-up (`blocking`, `worst`, `byReviewer`): `blocking: true` — any
reviewer's latest verdict is `block`, or a `revise` no newer verdict has
cleared — means do not integrate that task; call `replan_record` with a fix
task scoped to the findings instead, never a verbatim retry. Verdicts are
advisory-but-gating: a reviewer never touches code, but a block is a hard
stop on merging, not a suggestion. Reviewers never write production
features, and you never let a worker's own "looks good" stand in for a
review.

## 5. Budget tiers

Check the `budget` object returned by `worker_status`/`spawn_worker`:
- `ok` — spawn normally.
- `soft` — prefer cheaper/smaller models on your next spawns (the
  configured `small_model` downgrade); don't halt existing work.
- `hard` — stop spawning new workers entirely and tell the human before
  doing anything else. A refused `spawn_worker` call at this tier is
  expected behavior, not a bug to retry around.

## 6. Cleanup

Use `abort_worker(workerId, reason)` to stop a worker that's clearly
off-track before it burns more budget. Always record a real reason — it
goes into the run's audit trail.
